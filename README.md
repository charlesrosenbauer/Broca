# BROCA

Broca is a scripting language for text-based games.

It similar to Inkle's Ink language, though simpler.

It is written in C, and is currently a work-in-progress.


**Unfinished:**

* Parsing beyond basic tokenization
* Consistency checking
* Interpreter
* Compilation (to interpretable binary blob)
